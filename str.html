		<!-- About my Experiences paragraph -->
		<h1 class="print">Development Experiences</h1>
		<p>In the process of make this webpage I learned many things as well as I faced many problems and I tackled them all. 
           At first I had a hard time on my nagivation bars. The first nagivation bar that I made was not so attractive and was  
           very bad looking, so I decided to change my nagivation bar and I event took iedas from youtube. Then I got one 
           and decided to give it a try and I liked it. After that I gave my homepage a background image. I tried many 
           background images but only like this one. In my contact section and cv section I didn't had much problem finding 
           a background image because I had already thought about the background images. In my portfolio section and 
           site report section I decided not to put background image. Although I had tried diffrent images I didn't like any of 
           them so instead of the images I gave them colors. I also took help from a website called w3schools. </p>
           <!-- Overall Overview on webpage -->
        <h2 class="print">Overview</h2>
        <p>Starting at the first there is a Homepage. In the homepage there is only a warm welcome and at the top there is a 
           nagavation bar. From the hompage we can go to diffrent parts of the webpage i.e. portfolio, contacts, cv and sitereport. 
           In the hompage there is a background image of mount everest and I have used diffrent codes like opacity, z-index etc to 
           make it look good. Next we have Portfolio where there are two placeholders images. In this section there is no 
           background image but we have background color. I didn't put the background image because it didn't suited at all I tried 
           many images but none of them matched. So I have given it a red color texture in both nagavation bar as well as in the 
           background. Following to the next page is our Contacts. This page have a form where you can type your first name, last 
           name, email address and you can also leave your comments. In this page I have used codes like form, textarea, input etc.
           It has also a background image of a beautiful sunset. After that we have our Curriculum Viate also known as CV. In cv 
           I have made it a bit simple then other webpages. Here I have a small description about myself, about my education and my 
           skill and experiences. In the background I have an image of stars shining in the night. Lastly I have a sitereport, overhere
           I have written about my experiences while making this webpage. I aslo have a reference where I have referenced about all 
           the images and ideas. Then there are all the validator image of other webpages. </p>
